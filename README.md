## Updates to Portfolio
1. Converted portfolio to React.
2. Updated 'Work' section of portfolio to include 6 projects, instead of 5.
3. Resized the first project so all projects are the same size.
4. Replaced the modal that used to be displayed afer hitting a project image with a 'Project Details' section that is displayed in place of the 'About Me' and 'Works' sections of the page.  The Header and the Contact Me (i.e., footer) sections are still displayed to the user.  The user is able to return to the "home" page where the 'About Me' and 'Works' sections are displayed by hitting the links in the Header.
5. The application uses a React router for navigation.
6. The application is responsive.
